WARNING
-------

Work-in-progress, do not use yet!

---

A PHP extension using [libpoppler](http://poppler.freedesktop.org/).

This is (will be) a high-level binding (a bit like `pdfinfo` and `pdftotext`), and
does not expose the whole poppler API.

todo
----

* proper documentation
* setup/install stuff
* gcov on travis / https://github.com/eddyxu/cpp-coveralls

build
-----

    $ phpize
    $ ./configure
    $ make

functions
---------

    poppler_pdf_open($filename);

Returns a PopplerDocument resource, or `null` on errors.

    poppler_pdf_info(PopplerDocument $doc);

Returns an array with PDF meta-data.

    poppler_pdf_text(PopplerDocument $doc, $page_number);

Returns a string with the (unformatted) text of that page.

    poppler_pdf_formatted_text(PopplerDocument $doc, $page_number);

Returns a list of chunks of that page's text, including formatting
information.  The keys for each chunk are:
* `text` - the raw text
* `font_name` - the name of the font
* `font_size` - the font size
* `is_underlined` - whether or not the text is underlined (not very reliable)
